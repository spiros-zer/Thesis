	<span><strong><em>Abstract &mdash;</em></strong></span> The wireless network of today is the result of constantly increasing
	demands in the area of wireless communication. It’s value is visible at
	both an individual and a societal level and can be noticed by the rate
	of usage as well as from the new needs that arise from it. Whereas
	wireless technology is evolving at an ever growing pace, it’s progress
	is slowly coming at a halt due to the spectrum crunch, all the while
	demanding new technologies such as the Internet of Things, is pressing
	for ever larger rates and quantities in wireless transmissions. To
	tackle this obstacle, new techniques have been introduced to the status
	quo, one of which being the scheme of Index Modulation (IM). IM provides
	additional information by introducing activation states to the
	communication medium, thus offering a variety of integration methods. In
	the scope of this study, we focus on Time slot Index Modulation applied
	on a SISO (single-input single-output) wireless communication channel
	between transmitter and receiver. Furthermore, a residual carrier is
	used for transmitting the data signal, as well as a Phase-Locked Loop
	component by the receiver to undo the channel’s attenuation. Last but
	not least, the results of the experiment are presented and comparisons
	are made between the proposed scheme and currently used ones.
